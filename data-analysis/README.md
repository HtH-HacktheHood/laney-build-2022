# About this data ...

Given the fast pace that much of our society moves at today, not many people are being mindful of their sleeping habits. There are countless studies and technologies focused on the relationship between sleep and other parts of our health. One major topic is the analysis of physiological changes that occur while sleeping. The "SayoPillow.csv" dataset highlights various parameters such as the sleeper's snoring range, respiration rate, body temperature, limb movements, blood oxygen levels, eye movements, sleep duration, heart rate and stress levels.

# Why am I interested ...

I have always personally struggled with maintaining proper sleeping habits. Most nights, I do not get the recommended 8+ hours of sleep. It is also suggested to go to bed at the same time every night. This is also something that I am not the best at. Learning more about how sleep affects stress could be the motivation I need to train myself for proper slumbers!
