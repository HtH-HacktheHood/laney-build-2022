Below are three set's of numbers. Create three variables that are equal to each set: one number minus the other
'''
set1, set2, set3, = [25, 10], [50, 27], [61, 38]

'''
Below are three set's of numbers. Calculate the result of when the first number entered is raised to the power of the second number entered.
'''
set4, set5, set6, = [2, 3], [10, 7], [5, 4]

'''
Below are three set's of numbers. Calculate how many times the second number can be divided into the first number. For example if the first number entered was 23 and the second number entered was 4 the program should report 5 times
'''
set7, set8, set9, = [23, 4], [19, 3], [81, 13]

'''
